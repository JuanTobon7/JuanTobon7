## Hi there, I'm Juan Tobón! 👋

I'm a 20-year-old student at **University of Los Llanos**, a developer, and an enthusiastic learner!

- 🌱 I’m currently learning **PHP** and improving my **English**.
- 🎸 I enjoy playing the guitar during my free time.
- ⚽ I love playing football and practiced boxing for three years.
- 🙏 I am grateful to God for always being by my side and guiding me.
- 🎯 2025 Goals: Enhance my skills in PHP, contribute to open-source projects, and expand my coding knowledge.
- 😄 Fun fact: Always maintaining a positive attitude and energy to tackle challenges. While I focus seriously when coding, I enjoy connecting with others and staying cheerful.
